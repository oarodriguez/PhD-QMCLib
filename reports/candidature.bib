	abstract={For a system of weakly repelling bosons, a theory of the elementary line vortex excitations is developed. The vortex state is characterised by the presence of a finite fraction of the particles in a single particle state of integer angular momentum. The radial dependence of the highly occupied state follows from a self-consistent field equation. The radial function and the associated particle density are essentially constant everywhere except inside a core, where they drop to zero. The core size is the de Broglie wavelength associated with the mean interaction energy per particle. The expectation value of the velocity has the radial dependence of a classical vortex. In this Hartree approximation the vorticity is zero everywhere except on the vortex line. When the description of the state is refined to include the zero point oscillations of the phonon field, the vorticity is spread out over the core. These results confirm in all essentials the intuitive arguments ofOnsager andFeynman. The phonons moving perpendicular to the vortex line are coherent excitations of equal and opposite angular momentum relative to the substratum of moving particles that constitute the vortex. The vortex motion resolves the degeneracy of the Bogoljubov phonons with respect to the azimuthal quantum number.},

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 10(12) per cubic centimeter and could be preserved far more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

	abstract = {A rigorous one‐one correspondence is established between one‐dimensional systems of bosons and of spinless fermions. This correspondence holds irrespective of the nature of the interparticle interactions, subject only to the restriction that the interaction have an impenetrable core. It is shown that the Bose and Fermi eigenfunctions are related by $\psi$ B =$\psi$ F A, where A(x 1 {\ldots} xn ) is +1 or −1 according as the order pq {\ldots} r, when the particle coordinates xj are arranged in the order xp {\textless}xq {\textless} {\ldots} {\textless}xr , is an even or an odd permutation of 1 {\ldots} n. The energy spectra of the two systems are identical, as are all configurational probability distributions, but the momentum distributions are quite different. The general theory is illustrated by application to the special case of impenetrable point particles; the one‐one correspondence between bosons with this particular interaction and completely noninteracting fermions leads to a rigorous solution of this many‐boson problem.},

Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

    abstract={The critical BEC temperature Tc of a non interacting boson gas in a layered structure like those of cuprate superconductors is shown to have a minimum Tc,m, at a characteristic separation between planes am. It is shown that for a<am, Tc increases monotonically back up to the ideal Bose gas T0 suggesting that a reduction in the separation between planes, as happens when one increases the pressure in a cuprate, leads to an increase in the critical temperature. For finite plane separation and penetrability the specific heat as a function of temperature shows two novel crests connected by a valley in addition to the well-known BEC peak at Tc associated with the 3D behavior of the gas. For completely impenetrable planes the model reduces to many disconnected infinite slabs for which just one hump survives becoming a peak only when the slab widths are infinite.},

	abstract={The Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE) is discussed at the level of an advanced course on statistical physics. In the standard literature the GPE is usually obtained in the framework of the second quantization formalism, which in many cases goes beyond the material covered in many advanced undergraduate courses. In this paper, we motivate the derivation of the GPE in relationship to concepts from statistical physics, highlighting a number of applications from the dynamics of a Bose–Einstein condensate to the excitations of the gas cloud. This paper may be helpful for encouraging the discussion of modern developments in a statistical mechanics course, and can also be of use in other contexts such as mathematical physics and modelling. The paper is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for general physicists.}
